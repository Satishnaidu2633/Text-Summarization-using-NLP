# 📝 Text Summarization using NLP

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of **text summarization** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The notebook walks through how to clean, preprocess, and summarize a large piece of text using extractive summarization methods.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Regex-based text cleaning** to remove punctuation, special characters, and numbers  
- 🧹 **Stopword removal** using spaCy for improving the relevance of selected sentences  
- 📌 Designed to perform **Extractive Summarization** (selecting the most relevant sentences)  
- 📓 Clean, well-documented Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and reproducibility  

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `spacy` – for tokenization and stopword removal  
- `string` – for handling punctuation during preprocessing  
- `re` – for applying regex rules to clean text  
- `heapq` – to retrieve the top-ranked sentences based on frequency or scoring  
- `spacy.lang.en.stop_words` – to access the English stopword list

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satishnaidu2633/Text-Summarization-using-NLP
   cd Text-Summarization-NLP

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Here are some potential improvements and features that can be added to extend the project:

- ✅ **Abstractive Summarization** using transformer-based models like BART or T5 for more human-like summaries.
- 🌐 **Web Interface** using Streamlit or Gradio for interactive summarization via file upload or text input.
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics** such as ROUGE or BLEU scores to compare summarization quality.
- 📄 **Support for Multiple Documents** to summarize batches of files (e.g., articles, PDFs).
- 🌍 **Multilingual Summarization** by integrating language detection and model switching.
- 💾 **Save/Export Summaries** in PDF or TXT format.
- 🔌 **API Integration** to fetch and summarize content from news websites, blogs, or social media.
- 🧠 **Model Fine-Tuning** on custom datasets for domain-specific summarization (e.g., legal, medical).
